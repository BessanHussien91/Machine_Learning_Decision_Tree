# Machine_Learning_Decision_Tree
A decision tree is a widely used supervised machine learning algorithm that is primarily used for classification and regression tasks. It is a graphical representation of a decision-making process that involves making a series of choices based on the values of input features to reach a final decision or prediction.

In a decision tree, each internal node represents a decision based on a specific feature, and each branch represents the outcome of that decision. The leaves of the tree represent the final predicted class or value. The tree structure is constructed by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of different features. The goal is to create a tree that effectively splits the data into homogeneous subsets in terms of the target variable.

For classification tasks, the decision tree algorithm aims to divide the data into subsets that contain similar instances of the target class. For regression tasks, the algorithm aims to divide the data into subsets in a way that minimizes the variance of the target variable within each subset.

In summary, a decision tree is a versatile algorithm that builds a tree-like structure to make predictions or decisions based on input features, using a series of binary sp
